# Version 0.0.6a
##### The most recent Breadbot release!
----
This is the first (hopefully) working release of Breadbot. I acknowledge that 0.0.5a was unstable and didn't have everything I promised. 0.0.6a should be much more stable (with proper logging!) and has a ton more to it!
##### This version requires [JRE 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) to run! 

# Changelog ```0.0.5a -> 0.0.6a```
* Proper logging now done directly to console! (Find those pesky bugs)
* Large refractoring so it all makes sense
* Discord>Twitch Relay and Twitch>Discord Relay now working
* Added ```InviteUtility``` so you never have to login as the bot account!
* Added new ```#attach``` command to change the Home_Channel
* Config File should make more sense
* Added proper documentation to Wiki

# Installing
1. To run Breadbot, download and unzip ```0.0.6a.zip``` into the folder of your choice
2. Open up ```config.cfg``` and edit it to your liking
3. Double click ```run.bat``` to start the bot!
    * If you are on Linux, you will need to run the command ```java -jar 0.0.6a.jar```
