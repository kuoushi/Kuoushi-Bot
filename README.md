# BreadBot
Welcome to BreadBot! A swiss army knife of a bot that is aimed towards a twitch streamer! Using BreadBot should be
simple and come easily between setup to launching all systems within seconds. Check back as I develop the bot over
the next few months and will eventually release beta builds when I feel it can be run well.

## Usage

Each release will be installed and used differently because I will be changing things so rapidly. Checkout out the current release: [0.0.6](https://github.com/Birdgeek/BreadBot/releases/tag/0.0.6)

## Contributing

Although the bot is lacking severly thus far, you can still add some cool shit to the repo!
Follow these steps:
 1. Fork it!
 2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
 3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
 4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
 5. Submit a pull request :D

Or if you have an idea of what to add - go to the issues page and add a feature request!
## Credits

I'm using a few other libraries to make this all possible and they need some credit :)
